This project plans to gather data for weightlifting magazine.  The plan is to look at data from the 2021 World Weightlifting Championships and create a database using athletes, coaches, events and medals.

## Brief Description of the Database

A database named "Olympics" with sql tables showing the relationship between athletes, countries they represent, events they participated in, categories, weights of the winning lifts, and the medals each athlete won is created. 

- This database captures information about the athletes from each event, their country, gender and category they participated in.

## Purpose of Database

By using a relational database to load our data, we aim to create and provide meaningful information from the data. A relational database also helps us to understand the relationship between the tables and how they interact with each other. This Database will help the weightlifting magazine to decide which athlete and country to sponsor.
